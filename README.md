# 💡 Benchmarks.NET
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of performance benchmarks for the .NET ecosystem. It includes tests for fundamental C# concepts and comparative analyses of various third-party libraries. These benchmarks help developers understand the performance trade-offs and make informed decisions when building applications.

We use the [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet) tool to provide reliable and accurate data for key performance comparisons.

## 🤔 What is included in this repository?
**C# Fundamentals**:
    A deep dive into core language constructs, such as the performance differences between Array and IEnumerable or the trade-offs between if-else chains and switch-case statements.

**Library Comparisons**:
    Head-to-head performance tests of popular third-party libraries, highlighting the fastest and most memory-efficient options for common tasks.
